# Motivation: lifetime-infected `dyn Any` erasure

</span>

<!-- toc -->

### A brief introduction about `Any : 'static`

Depending on your Rust needs, you may have needed to use type erasure, using
`dyn Trait`s, and in the more extreme case, you might not have had a single
`Trait` behind which to hide your types other than `Any`, the API that consists
of `dyn`amic/at-runtime type identification, which thereby allows guessing the
originally erased type, so as to undo the `dyn` erasure if we get it right
(called type downcasting).

The issue in question, here, is with lifetimes:

  - `dyn Any` is a type with no lifetime within it (it is `: 'static`), so any lifetime information
    present in the original type before erasure is not present in the static/compile-time/type-level
    information of `dyn Any`.

  - but lifetimes are purely a compile-time construct!

      - (technically you can implement a Rust compiler that skips
        borrow-checking and directly tries to compile the (hopefully correct) code into machine
        code, and if you do that then your compiler will be able to fully[^ignoring_lifetimes]
        ignore lifetimes).

[^ignoring_lifetimes]: `for<'a, 'b>`-arity, on the other hand, does play a role and is able to lead to different monomorphizations, though. Otherwise `fn(&str) -> &str` and `fn(&str) -> &'static str)`, which are both `: 'static` would be mixed up by `Any`.

  - this means that it won't be possible to query back that lost lifetime information within the
    runtime/`dyn`amic self-type-identification machinery.

So, because of this, types are not allowed to carry lifetime information/restrictions within them, in
order for them be soundly erasable to `dyn Any`: this property is achieved thanks to the notorious
`: 'static` bound on `Any`.

But this, then, leads to the following legitimate question:

### Is it possible to have a type-erasure mechanism allowing downcasts to lifetime-infected types?

Based on the previous section you may be tempted to say no, except for one important detail around
which we can try to work:

> `dyn Any` is a type with no lifetime within it (it is `: 'static`)

What about `dyn Any + 'lt`, then?

As a thought experiment, let's imagine having a `&'static i32`, such as `&42` (thanks to [`static`
promotion](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1414-rvalue_static_promotion.html)).

This is a `: 'static` type, so it can be coÃ«rced to a `dyn Any`, with the `TypeId::of::<&i32>()`.

Now say you have a `&'u i32`. What if, with a lil unsafe, we did the following:

```rust ,ignore
use ::core::any::Any;

/// Is this sound?
fn we_do_a_lil_unsafe<'u>(
    r: &'u i32,
) -> Box<dyn 'u + Any>
{
    // Safety: this `'static` is immediately erased to `dyn 'u + â€¦`, so the
    // resulting entity won't be usable beyond `'u`.
    let r: &'static i32 = unsafe { ::core::mem::transmute(r) };
    Box::new(r)
}
```

What do you think of this snippet? Is it sound?

Well, the following compiling just fine is a bit problematic, is it not?

```rust ,edition2018
use ::core::any::Any;

fn wOnT_bE_uSaBlE_bEyOnD<'u>(
    r: Box<dyn 'u + Any>
) -> Box<dyn 'static + Any>
{
    r
}
```

  - Indeed, `: 'static` is a super-bound of `Any`, meaning that whenever something is `: Any`,
    then it also is `: 'static`! So a `Box<dyn 'u + Any>` is actually a
    `Box<dyn 'u + 'static + Any>`, which, in turn, is a `Box<dyn 'static + Any>` since `: 'a + 'b`
    is equivalent to `: union('a, 'b) ~ max('a, 'b) = 'static when 'b = 'static` (people often
    trip up on this, since they're so used to seeing `+ 'u` as a max-bound of usability of items,
    when it's actually _a lower bound_.

    Same as with `FnMut()` and `FnOnce()`, for instance: whilst
    an arbitrary `F : FnOnce()` may only be callable once (conservative assumption _barring extra
    information_), a `F : FnOnce() + FnMut()` is not an oxymoron, but just a plain `F : FnMut()`.
    It's the same with `: 'region_of_usability`)

    In other words, the very `: 'static` which had been slapped onto `Any` for soundness, is
    actually the one giving, here, a capability which makes `dyn Any`s "too strong", and thus,
    unsound-prone; for custom shenanigans such as this one at least.

    <div style="text-align: center;"><img
        src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9920355/258630076-ac1917fb-ac61-407c-a000-01e68dc51974.png"
        height = "150px"
        title = "ironic"
        alt = "the irony is rich"
    /></div>

Hum, this will require some extra hoops then. Let's try to rewrite `Any` but without the mandatory
`: 'static` available to `dyn`s:

```rust ,edition2018
use ::core::any::TypeId;

// for reference, `Any`'s definition:
#[cfg(feature = "ðŸŽ¶ if I were a core ðŸŽ¶")]   /* https://youtu.be/4U_RvUYINpo */
mod real_any {
    pub
    trait Any : 'static {
        fn type_id(&self) -> TypeId;
    }
    impl<T : ?Sized + 'static> Any for T {
        fn type_id(&self) -> TypeId {
            TypeId::of::<T>()
        }
    }
}

pub
trait MyAny : seal::StaticSealed {
    fn type_id(&self) -> TypeId;
}

impl<T : ?Sized + 'static> MyAny for T {
    fn type_id(&self) -> TypeId {
        TypeId::of::<Self>()
    }
}

// Main trick: this, much like `Any`'s own `: 'static`, makes `: 'static` a
// mandatory step to be `MyAny`, but the big difference is that despite
// the requirement, we don't get the reverse implication: as far as Rust is
// concerned, there could exist `T : MyAny` for which `T : 'static` would
// not hold!
mod seal {
    pub trait StaticSealed {}
    impl<T : ?Sized + 'static> StaticSealed for T {}
}

// --------------------------------

// from there, the usual downcasting shenanigans:
impl dyn '_ + MyAny {
    pub
    fn is<T : 'static>(&self) -> bool {
        self.type_id() == TypeId::of::<T>()
    }

    pub
    fn downcast_ref<T : 'static>(&self) -> Option<&T> {
        self.is::<T>().then(|| unsafe {
            &*(self as *const Self as *const T)
        })
    }
}

/// Is this sound?
fn we_do_a_lil_unsafe<'u>(
    r: &'u i32,
) -> Box<dyn 'u + MyAny>
{
    // Safety: this `'static` is immediately erased to `dyn 'u + â€¦`,
    // so the resulting entity won't be usable beyond `'u`.
    let r: &'static i32 = unsafe { ::core::mem::transmute(r) };
    Box::new(r)
}
```

And now to check that the `'u` is an effective bound:

```rust ,compile_fail
fn lets_see_the_region_of_usability<'u, 'tell_me>(
    input: Box<dyn 'u + MyAny>
) -> impl 'tell_me + Sized
{
    input
}
```

yields:

```rust ,ignore
error: lifetime may not live long enough
  --> src/lib.rs:67:5
   |
63 | fn lets_see_the_region_of_usability<'u, 'tell_me>(
   |                                     --  -------- lifetime `'tell_me` defined here
   |                                     |
   |                                     lifetime `'u` defined here
...
67 |     input
   |     ^^^^^ function was supposed to return data with lifetime `'tell_me` but it is returning data with lifetime `'u`
   |
   = help: consider adding the following bound: `'u: 'tell_me`
```

So any `'tell_me` so that a `Box<dyn 'u + MyAny>` may be used, has to satisfy `'u âŠ‡ 'tell_me`,
_i.e._, the biggest such one is `'u` itself, _i.e._, a `Box<dyn 'u + MyAny>` is very much
_not usable beyond `'u`_.

So all is good, right?

    alt="right?"
    title="right?"
    height="200px"

```rust ,ignore
fn uh_oh<'u>(
    r: Box<dyn 'u + MyAny>,
) -> &'static i32
{
    *r.downcast_ref::<&i32>().unwrap()
}
```

Indeed, whilst returning a properly `'u`-bounded entity was _necessary_ for soundness, it was not
_sufficient_: a `'u`-bounded entity may still allow certain APIs to extract non-`'u`-bounded stuff
out of it!

And in this instance, the very API allowing downcasts was the culprit:

```rust ,ignore
impl<'u> dyn 'u + MyAny {
    pub
    fn downcast_ref<'r, R : 'static>(
        self: &'r (dyn 'u + MyAny),
    ) -> Option<&'r R>
    {
        self.is:<R>().then(|| unsafe {
            &*(self as *const Self as *const R)
        })
    }
}
```

which, for `R = &'static i32`, becomes:

```rust ,ignore
impl<'u> dyn 'u + MyAny {
    pub
    fn downcast_ref<'r, &'static i32>(
        self: &'r (dyn 'u + MyAny),
    ) -> Option<&'r &'static i32>
    {
        (self.type_id() == TypeId::of::<&'static i32>()).then(|| unsafe {
            &*(self as *const Self as *const T)
        })
    }
}
```

Notice how we end up with a check from `self.type_id()` (which returns `TypeId::of::<&'static i32>()`
for our constructed value), against the very same `TypeId::of::<&'static i32>()`.

The check passes, and we end up with a `&'r &'static i32`, with `'r` being the lifetime of the
`self: &'r (dyn 'u + MyAny)` receiver.

Which is properly `'r`-bounded and thus `'u`-bounded (since `'u âŠ‡ 'r`), but from which we can simply
extract the `&'static i32`, unbounded, by simple `*`-dereference.

Uh-oh.

> So our API is not sound _yet_.

Before tackling a more general fix to this problem, let's palliate it by replacing our
`downcast_ref` above with the following more limited API:

<details><summary>Click here to see intermediary steps</summary>

 1. We had:
    ```rust ,ignore
    impl<'u> dyn 'u + MyAny {
        pub
        fn downcast_ref<'r, R : 'static>(
            self: &'r (dyn 'u + MyAny),
        ) -> Option<&'r R>
        {
            self.is:<R>().then(|| unsafe {
                &*(self as *const Self as *const R)
            })
        }
    }
    ```

 1. From there, we narrow the generic `R` down to the `&'static T` shape:
    ```rust ,ignore
    impl<'u> dyn 'u + MyAny {
        pub
        fn downcast_ref<'r, T : 'static>(
            self: &'r (dyn 'u + MyAny),
        ) -> Option<&'r &'static T>
        {
            self.is:<&'static T>().then(|| unsafe {
                &*(self as *const Self as *const &'static T)
            })
        }
    }
    ```

 1. And finally:

</details>

```rust ,ignore
impl<'u> dyn 'u + MyAny {
    /* no more downcast_ref! ðŸ‘ˆ */
    pub
    fn downcast_bounded_ref<'r, T : 'static>(
        self: &'r (dyn 'u + MyAny),
    ) -> Option<&'r &'u T>
    { //         ðŸ‘‡   ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†
        self.is::<&T>().then(|| unsafe {
            //                                ðŸ‘‡
            &*(self as *const Self as *const &'static T) // : &'r &'static T
                                                         // : &'r &'u      T
        })
    }
}
```

  - The main difference is that the `TypeId` check now unconditionally targets `&T` references,
    rather than arbitrarily generic `T`s. In other words, if we name `R` the argument given to
    `TypeId::of`, we are restricting ourselves to `R = &T = &_` types.

    By doing this, we were then able to do another thing: rather than returning `-> &R` _i.e._,
    `-> &&'static T`, which was problematic, we instead returned `&&'u T`, thereby having restricted
    the problematic lifetime accordingly!

    As a matter of fact, the very reason to restrict `R` down to the `&'_ T` shape was to be able
    to, upfront, get access to a lifetime placeholder wherein we'd be able to manually replace the
    problematic `'static` with `'u`. This notion of replacing a classic generic parameter with
    a restricted shape so that a lifetime placeholder be exposed upfront ought to sound very similar
    to the [`sort_by_key_ref()` signature in our `sort_by_key()` chapter](
    ./explain-sort-by-lifetimes.md#solving-the-returned-borrow-problem).

Finally, we can simplify it down a bit by realizing the outer `&'r` is not playing any role here:
if we are to return `-> &'r &'u T`, we may as well return `&'u T`! Much like we return `-> bool`s
rather than `&bool`:

```rust ,ignore
impl<'u> dyn 'u + MyAny {
    /* no more downcast_ref! */
    pub
    fn downcast_bounded_ref<'r, T : 'static>(
        self: &'r (dyn 'u + MyAny),
    ) -> Option<&'u T>
    {
        self.is::<&T>().then(|| unsafe {
            &*(self as *const Self as *const &'static T) // : &'r &'static T
                                                         // : &'r &'u      T
        })
        .map(|r: &'r &'u T| -> &'u T { *r }) // for convenience
    }
}
```

**With this API, we finally got `we_do_a_lil_unsafe()` to become a sound API!**

```rust ,ignore
/// Sound!
pub
fn we_do_a_lil_unsafe<'u>(
    r: &'u i32,
) -> Box<dyn 'u + MyAny>
{
    // SAFETY:
    //  1. this `'static` is immediately erased to `dyn 'u + â€¦`,
    //     so the resulting entity won't be usable beyond `'u`;
    //  2. the only way to extract this `&i32` back from a `dyn MyAny` is
    //     through `downcast_bounded_ref`, which also yields a `'u`-bounded &i32
    let r: &'static i32 = unsafe { ::core::mem::transmute(r) };
    Box::new(r)
}
```

So, until now, we've been attempting to `dyn Any`-erase a `&'u i32`, but _quid_ of other
`'u`-infected types?

#### How well does this generalize to another lifetime-infected type such as `Cell<&_>`?
